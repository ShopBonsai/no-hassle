## [3.0.1] - 2023-02-13

- ðŸ’¥ **Important**: Version `3.0.0` is not to be used as this patch introduces more breaking changes. It is the "true" version 3, as both breaking changes should have been released simultaneously.
- ðŸ”¥ Removed default `DEFAULT_API_KEY_HEADER`, this will be provided by the package user.
- ðŸ’¥ Removed `authOptions` and changed `auth` in `ISwaggerOptions` to be more flexible. Allows multiple `securityDefinitions` and a custom root-level `security`.
- âœ¨ Allows passing `security` at the operation/route level to specify the authentication to use with individual routes.

## [3.0.0] - 2023-02-10
